# Go Lift TV - Chevereto Free

The changes in this fork allow Nginx proxy auth. [I use this](https://golift.tv/img/)
behind [Organizr](https://github.com/causefx/Organizr) with Nginx proxy auth.
**If you use this code you must protect your login and signup paths!**
This only allows usernames without `@`'s in them (not email addresses), and the signup
form  mentions plex.tv and captain. You should consider customizing that page yourself,
but make note of the changes here.

This is the running nginx config. Chevereto is installed at `/config/www/img/`.
```shell
location /img {
  root /config/www/;
  index index.php;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /img/index.php?$query_string;

  location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "upload_max_filesize=512M \n post_max_size=512M";
    fastcgi_pass            127.0.0.1:9000;
    fastcgi_index           index.php;
    include                 /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
  }

  # Allow any "User" to signup for an account.
  location /img/signup {
    auth_request     /auth-4;
    auth_request_set $webuser $upstream_http_x_organizr_user;
    include          /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param    X-WEBAUTH-USER $webuser;
    fastcgi_param    SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/img/index.php;
    fastcgi_param    SCRIPT_NAME /img/index.php;
    fastcgi_pass     127.0.0.1:9000;
  }

  # Allow anyone to reach the login form, and pass any proxy auth credentials.
  location /img/login {
    auth_request     /auth-999;
    auth_request_set $webuser $upstream_http_x_organizr_user;
    include          /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param    X-WEBAUTH-USER $webuser;
    fastcgi_param    SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/img/index.php;
    fastcgi_param    SCRIPT_NAME /img/index.php;
    fastcgi_pass     127.0.0.1:9000;
  }
}
```

Chevereto is an image hosting software that allows you to create a beautiful and full-featured image hosting website on your own server. It's your hosting and your rules, so say goodbye to closures and restrictions. This repo here is Chevereto Free, which is a fork of Chevereto V3 in which only the most essential features are preserved and it is released as Open Source software.

## Building the next-gen Chevereto

Chevereto is being modernized by introducing new coding standards and turning towards a common Open Source base. [Read all updates](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/building-the-next-gen-chevereto.11140/) and check my [Chevere + Chevereto V4 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DCZhECwN/chevere-chevereto-v4).

## Minimum system requirements

Make sure your server meets the minimum system requirements which are:

- PHP 7 (PHP 5.6 min)
- MySQL 8 / MariaDB 10 (ALL PRIVILEGES)
- Apache / NGiNX web server

The system has a built-in system check that will tell you right away when you need to fix something on your server.

## Installation

Chevereto can be installed in several different ways, it all depends on what suits you best.

### ‚ö°Install using Installer

The [installer](https://github.com/Chevereto/Installer) is a single `.php` file which will download and extract the latest release for you. Automatic database setup for cPanel based web servers.

1. Download the [Chevereto Installer](https://chevereto.com/download/file/installer)
2. Upload the `installer.php` file to your target `public_html` folder.
3. Open your website and follow the steps.

### üê≥Install using Docker

Docker allows you to easily install and maintain all the server dependencies with ease by using automated application containers. The ready-to-use Docker images are under [nmtan/chevereto](https://hub.docker.com/r/nmtan/chevereto/) (many thanks to [Tan Nguyen](https://github.com/tanmng))

### ‚ú®Install using Softaculous/Fantastico

## Updates

Chevereto has a built-in system that checks for new updates every day via the [Chevereto API](https://chevereto.com/api/get/info/free). The system will notify you when an update is available, and it will guide you through the process.

## Upgrade to paid edition

Chevereto Free has the same look and feel of the [paid version](https://chevereto.com). Most likely it will fit all your personal needs. The features removed in this fork are those business-oriented like external storage servers or banner management to name a few. To upgrade to our paid edition, simply navigate to your dashboard panel and click on the `upgrade` button.
